Machine Learning
================


I provide an overview of machine learning in this chapter and 
in later chapters cover in detail using the Weka library, neural
networks, and deep learning neural networks.

The structure of this chapter was inspired by
Andrew Ng's excellent Machine Learning class offered by Coursera.
