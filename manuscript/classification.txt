# Classification {#classification}


We used neural networks to classify data sets in the
[Chapter on Neural Networks](#neural-networks). In this chapter we will look at two
additional techniques for classifying data: Bayesian Classifiers and
Support-Vector Machines.

Bayesian Classifiers
--------------------

We will use the ci-bayes open source (Artistic License) library in this
section. This library is patterned after examples in Toby Segaran’s book
“Programming Collective Intelligence”.

TBD

Support-Vector Machines
-----------------------

We will use the LIBSVM library found on the web site
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ cjlin/libsvm/ in this section. A JAR file is
included with th ZIP file for this book as well as the LIBSVM license.
