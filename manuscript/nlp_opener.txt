# Natural Language Processing using the opeNER Framework {#opener-nlp}

I hope that the last chapter provided you with both an understanding of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Java code that is easy to understand and
modify for your own projects. I want to provide you in this chapter
with more tools for incorporating NLP technologies into the systems that you design and implement.
I am borrowing heavily from my own experience and project requirements in writing this chapter.
I hope that reading about my experience will be interesting and useful to you.

Starting in early 2014 I started modifying and improving my commercial product
[knowledgebooks.com](http://knowledgebooks.com) that is a document repository system
with advanced search and natural language query functionality. This is a one-man
project and to save developent effort I was looking to replace as much of the required functionality as possible with
open source software with a "commercial friendly" license (i.e., an Apache 2, MIT, or LGPL license).
I originally looking at the excellent Stanford NLP library but its GPL license
was not compatible with my requirements for a commercial product.

I decided to use the European Union funded project opeNER.

## Overview of opeNER

TBD

## Understanding the XML representation of Data used in the opeNER Processing Pipeline

TBD


## Setting up opeNER Command Line Utilities

The command line tools can be installed on your laptop or server for local development. The only part of the opeNER
system that we will use that can not be installed locally is a component to augment NER by searching DBPedia for
cononical URIs to represent entities like people, countries, companies, etc.

## Setting up opeNER as a Service

## Using Results from the opeNER Pipeline in Java Applications
