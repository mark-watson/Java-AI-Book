Conclusions
===========

The material in this book was informed by my own work experience
designing systems and writing software for artificial intelligence and information processing. If
you enjoyed reading this book and you make practical use of at least some of
the material I covered, then I consider my effort to be worthwhile.

Writing software is a combination of a business activity, promoting good
for society, and an exploration to try out new ideas for self
improvement. I believe that there is sometimes a fine line between
spending too many resources tracking many new technologies versus
getting stuck using old technologies at the expense of lost
opportunities. My hope is that reading this book was an efficient and
pleasurable use of your time, letting you try some new techniques and
technologies that you had not considered before.

When we do expend resources to try new things it is almost always best
to perform many small experiments and then dig deeper into areas that
have a good chance of providing high value and capturing your interest.

Fail fast is a common meme but failure that we do not learn from is a
waste.

I have been using the Java platform from the very beginning and although
I also use many other programming languages in my work and studies, both
the Java language and the Java platform provide high efficiency, scalability,
many well-trained developers, and a wealth of existing infrastructure
software and libraries. Investment in Java development also pays when
using alternative JVM languages like JRuby, Scala, and Clojure.

If we never get to meet in person or talk on the telephone, then I would
like to thank you now for taking the time to read my book.
