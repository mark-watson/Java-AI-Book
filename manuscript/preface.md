Preface
=======

The latest edition of this book is always available on [leanpub.com/javaai](https://leanpub.com/javaai).

I have been developing commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and
applications since the 1980s.

I wrote this book for both professional programmers and home hobbyists
who already know how to program in Java and who want to learn practical
AI programming and information processing techniques. I have tried to
make this an enjoyable book to work through. In the style of a “cook
book,” the chapters can be studied in any order. Most chapters follow
the same pattern: a motivation for learning a technique, some theory for
the technique, and a Java example program that you can experiment with.
[My Java example programs for this book can be found on github](https://github.com/mark-watson/Java-AI-Book-Code) and can be used
under both the LGPL3 and Apache 2 licenses - choose whichever of these two
licenses that works best for you.

My goal is to teach you both the theory of common AI techniques and to
provide you with Java source code to save you some time and effort.
Because my example code is licensed under the LGPL you can use the code
for any purposes including commercial applications. Your only
responsibility for using my LGPL licensed code is that if you improve the
code, you should make your changes to my example code public, preferably
by sharing them with me so readers of future editions of this
book can benefit from your improvements.

I have been interested in AI since reading Bertram Raphael’s excellent
book *Thinking Computer: Mind Inside Matter* in the early 1980s. I have
also had the good fortune to work on many interesting AI projects
including the development of commercial expert system tools for the
Xerox LISP machines and the Apple Macintosh, development of commercial
neural network tools, application of natural language and expert systems
technology, medical information systems, application of AI technologies
to Nintendo and PC video games, and the application of AI technologies
to the financial markets. I have also applied statistical natural
language processing techniques to analyzing social media data from
Twitter and Facebook.

I enjoy AI programming, and hopefully this enthusiasm will also infect
you the reader.

**Software Licenses for example programs in this book**

My example programs are licensed under the LGPL version 3 and/or Apache 2. I use several
open source libraries and their licenses are:

-   Drools Expert System Demos: Apache style license

-   PowerLoom Reasoning: LGPL

-   Sesame Semantic Web: LGPL

**Acknowledgements**

I process the manuscript for this book using the [leanpub.com](http://leanpub.com) publishing system and I recommend leanpub.com to other authors. Write one manuscript and use leanpub.com to generate assets for PDF, iPad/iPhone, and Kindle versions.

I would like to thank Kevin Knight for writing a flexible framework for
game search algorithms in *Common LISP* (Rich, Knight 1991) and for
giving me permission to reuse his framework, rewritten in Java for some
of the examples in the [Chapter on Search](#search). I would like to thank my
friend Tom Munnecke for my photo in this Preface. I have a library
full of books on AI and I would like to thank the authors of all of
these books for their influence on my professional life. I frequently
reference books in the text that have been especially useful to me and
that I recommend to my readers.

In particular, I would like to thank the authors of the following two
books that have had the most influence on me:

-   Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig’s *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
    Approach* which I consider to be the best single reference book for
    AI theory

-   John Sowa’s book *Knowledge Representation* is a resource that I
    frequently turn to for a holistic treatment of logic, philosophy,
    and knowledge representation in general
