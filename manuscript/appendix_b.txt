# Using the Example Code with Clojure

Clojure with Java libraries is a great combination because you get to reuse already written Java libraries and you have the ability to quickly and interactively call Java code via the Clojure *repl*.

It is easy using Java code in Clojure projects. I usually package Java libraries as-is in a JAR file for use in Clojure projects and do a local **mvn install** to make the Java library code easily usable with lein project.clj files.

Another approach I sometimes use is to include the Java source code in my Clojure project and setup project.clj to compile the Java code.

We will look at both of these approaches in this appendix.
